# Python 3 and IDE Setup

If you've already installed Python and an IDE, you can [proceed with "Getting Started"](getting-started.md).

## Installing Python

### Windows

If you haven't installed Python yet, [you can download the installer here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

This project requires Python 3.9 or newer, so make sure you download the correct
one.

### Linux distributions

Install Python with the package manager of your distribution.

!!! info 
    If you get the error "No module named 'tkinter'", you have to install the
    Python package with tkinter included. For example, *python3-tk* for ubuntu.
    [Here is a relevant StackOverflow post.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25905540/importerror-no-module-named-tkinter)

## Installing an IDE of your choice

You can develop Python scripts using a simple text editor. However, using an IDE
is recommended because it makes developing a bit easier:

- You can use autocompletion for functions and variables
- You can debug more efficiently
- You get syntax and error highlighting
