# Virtual MQTT Scenario

This project simulates a virtual scenario with MQTT devices with Python. The
communication between devices is purely done over MQTT Messages, without the use
of shared variables or data.

The simulation can be used for educational purposes for remote learning, as
there are no hardware requirements.

## Getting Started

If you haven't installed or worked with Python 3 yet, go to [setup](general/setup.md).

After that, you can setup your local MQTT broker
with [mosquitto and docker](general/mosquitto-setup.md).

After installing Python 3 and configuring your MQTT broker, you
can [follow the instructions here to setup and run this project](general/getting-started.md) .

An introduction to the Smart Home virtual MQTT
scenario [can be found here](scenarios/smart-home/introduction.md).
